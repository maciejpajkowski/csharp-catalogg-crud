# CATALOGG!

**CATALOGG** is a very simple CRUD*-type console application for basic data management. It is used to store basic information about video games, such as their title, genre and developer.

The application has been built entirely for the learning purposes and it should not be treated as a fully-fledged product, which will change your life. It probably won't.

It's still missing many cool features, which may or may not be implemented in the future, as I am still learning C# and may want to develop something more interesting than this. Still, I am proud of myself that I was able to build this application entirely by myself, no tutorials included.

## v1.0.0 - 21st June 2018

* Added an option to add items to the Catalogg
* Added an option to remove items from the Catalogg
* Added an option to edit items in the Catalogg
* Added an option to view items in the Catalogg
* Launched the app into GitHub!

In its current state Catalogg is not very useful, as it doesn't have any file writing/reading capabilities, thus making any data entered into it usable only during the the app's run time. Once the app is closed - the data is gone.

*- Create, Read, Update, Delete
